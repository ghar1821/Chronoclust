# Cluster labelling
This package contains all the modules to label chronoclust cluster with a ground truth.

The operation is performed by comparing the distance between cluster centroid and all ground truth (true cluster) centroid.
A cluster is assigned the label of its nearest ground truth (using preferred euclidean distance).

Please read the paper to see more details.
